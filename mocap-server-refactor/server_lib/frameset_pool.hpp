// Slots are preallocated and recycled through two queues, so steady state does
// no allocation. A slot is in exactly one of three places: available, ready, or
// held by the consumer between try_acquire and release.
//
// Crossed by two threads, the event loop pushing and the consumer acquiring,
// but only the two queues are shared. A slot is in exactly one place at a
// time, so whoever holds it owns its contents outright and needs no lock to
// touch them.
//
// Locking the queues rather than going lock free is what buys the ability to
// drop the oldest completed set: an SPSC pair cannot, because dropping means
// the producer popping the consumer's end.
